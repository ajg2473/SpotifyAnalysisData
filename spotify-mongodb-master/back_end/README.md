# Simple Node backend
This is a very simple node server with a good baseline for the rest of our project.

## What you will need
1. Nodejs (v8 or later)
2. npm (v6 or later)
3. Our db
    - Make sure you download this [tar-ed db (from google drive) ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13tIfhM4N4TgUAy_o5qn-GUU4ch8e3e5b/view?usp=sharing) and put it in your db path. (If your mongo server stops working after this, talk to me. You probably have to fix your permissions).

## To get it running

1. Navigate to the `back_end` folder in your command line
2. run `npm ci`
3. run `npm start`
    - The console will output what port to navigate to. The default is 3005
4. navigate to `localhost:3005/`
    - Use whatever port was outputted in step 3
